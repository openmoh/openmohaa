## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Server

- Feature to name bots (most requested bot feature). See the [bot documentation](https://github.com/openmoh/openmohaa/blob/main/docs/markdown/03-configuration/01-configuration.md#bots). This may change in the future.
- More settings for bots. See the [documentation](https://github.com/openmoh/openmohaa/blob/main/docs/markdown/03-configuration/03-configuration-bots.md) for settings.
- Reason will be sent to clients getting kicked automatically by the game for teamkill or inactivity.
- Reflective team damage feature. See the [documentation](https://github.com/openmoh/openmohaa/blob/main/docs/markdown/03-configuration/02-configuration-server.md#g_teamdamage) for settings and explanations.

#### General

- Added the bot count (if there are any) in the server browser. This will only work for servers running at least the version **0.83.0** of OpenMoHAA. The bot count will also show on the [333networks](https://master.333networks.com/) master server website.

### Fixed

#### Server

- Allow `g_teamkillkick` to be set to 0. Players would get kicked when this variable was set to 0 (also occurs in the original game).
- Fix a possible crash caused by scripts using `angles_pointat` (also occurs in the original game).
- Fix death animation movement for bots.
- Fix improper weapon falling rotation.
- Fix players temporarily losing user input control on ARM-based OpenMoHAA servers when a message contained a special ASCII character.
- Fix some RCON programs not working with `dumpuser`.
- Fix the round limit being always `15` on Tug-of-War.
- The player would spawn with no weapons on single-player when `sv_maxbots` was set (#783).

#### Clients

- Fix not being able to view sniper zoom when spectating.
- Fix the issue where the network would no longer work after hosting a multiplayer game on Allied Assault using the client.

### Changed

- Completely refactor CMake build system (from [ioquake3's](<https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3>) new CMake build system).

## [0.82.1] - 2025-08-05

### Fixed

#### Crashes

- Fixed a crash that would occur when loading custom maps in some map packs (due to a UI incorrectly declaring a widget: loadingbar, twice) (#764)
- Fixed an issue where the server could crash MOHAA base (1.11) clients in certain situations (#778)
- The game no longer terminate with error `FS_ReadFile with empty name`. (#772)

#### Drawing & rendering

- Fixed force model always using an allied skin for dead bodies.
- Fixed HUD being shown during briefings (#767)
- Fixed in-game mouse cursor disappearing on some platforms (#765)
- Set a more distant fog for d-day by default (`set g_ddayfog 0`). This fixes an issue with sky artifacts in m3l1a. (#770)

#### Multiplayer

- Fixed frequent telefrags on servers with a lot of players, like 25 players.
- Fixed taunts being played as team rather than global (#775)

#### Miscellaneous

- Update third-party libraries like jpeg and zlib.

## [0.82.0] - 2025-08-05

### Added

#### General

- Commands `add`, `subtract`, `scale`, `append` and `bitset`. `bitset`, which comes from mohaab, is particulary useful to set flags for flag-based variables like `dmflags`.
- Logfile timestamping. It's enabled by default with the `com_logfile_timestamps` cvar. The current time is displayed at the beginning of each log entry.
- Setup files (.msi packages) are now distributed for Windows.
- Update check. The game will verify the latest version in the background (by querying the latest GitHub release of the repository) and print a 
- Added the **Instant Action** feature from Breakthrough. This feature, although only usable through the Breakthrough UI, allows anyone to quickly find and join popular low-ping multiplayer servers.

#### Multiplayer

- Added `(all)` prefix in text message when a player is talking to all
- A message will be printed into console/log when a client changes their name.
- In Spearhead and Breakthrough, axis players can now select the kar98 sniper by choosing a german panzer skin (this was one of the feature of Daven's patch).
- The client number and their IP address will be printed next to each action (text message, joined the game...)

##### Bots

- [Recast Navigation](https://recastnav.com/) is now used by default to generate the navigation for bots. It's all automatic and works out of the box for any level, there is no need for `mp-navigation.pk3`. It provides a better and more accurate ways for bots to navigate through the maps.
  - Bots can now take path that requires jumping, falling or climbing ladders.
  - Bots will now try to get around small obstacles in front of them.

*Note: bigger obstacles are minimally supported, but may cause some issues in some area, like the West axis spawn in Omaha Beach.*

It takes less than 2 seconds to generate the navigation mesh on large maps like Berlin and Druckkammern.

If you have issues, executing `set g_navigation_legacy 1` command and then reloading the map will fallback to the basic pathnode-based navigation system.

### Fixed

#### Audio

- Updated OpenAL to version 1.24.3
  - The sound quality has improved a little bit, the new version of OpenAL uses another sound resampler by default.
- Fixed enhanced audio spatialization being forcefully enabled when it shouldn't for audio devices detected as headphones that aren't headphones.

#### General

- Fixed `LOCALIZATION ERROR` spam.
- Fixed an infinite loop that would occur during name sanitization.
- Fixed a crash that would occur when using special menus (like admin menus).
- Fixed memory leaks after the process has been running for a long time.
- Fixed player name being cutoff at the first negative character
- Fixed player being able to shoot bullets from under the LOD terrain (also occurs on the original game)

- Player models (selected skins) will be reset to their default value in-game if it doesn't exist, and force models will not work if the model doesn't exist on the server.
- Reallow client `name` to be changed by the server. Names are often changed by administrators to fix duplicate names.

#### Multiplayer

- Correctly print the text of instant messages in the console/logfile.

- Fixed a crash related to spawnpoints.
- Fixed a crash that would occur when playing a sound with subtitle without player #0.
- Fixed a crash that occured when a player reconnects to the same slot (after timing out) and then displays the scoreboard

- Fixed a possible crash when loading a map with lightmaps and then loading a map that has no lightmaps.
- Fixed a rare crash that would occur when toggling the scoreboard (also occurs in original game, but was fixed in Breakthrough 2.30).

- Fixed some programs not being able to retrieve the complete list of players
- Fixed `SV_FindIndex: overflow` errors that would occur more often than the original game during long matches.
- Fixed server crashing all clients under rare occasions.

### Changed

- Removed the architecture suffix from executables. They're now simply named `openmohaa` and `omohaaded`, for multiple reasons:
  - Avoids conflicts with shipped third-party DLLs (like SDL, OpenAL) which have no suffix.
  - Easier to build an installer and document.
  - Makes launchers and automation scripts simpler (universal name for executable files).
  - The architecture is already indicated in the archive name, on startup and in the `version` variable.*

- Older saves are incompatible due to changes from commit 4e8ddf3c358baef7cbfe2c8ff66c2426338cd2c7.

#### Client

- A random number is now added for the default name, like `UnnamedSoldier#1234`, or `*** Blank Name #1234 ***`.

#### Multiplayer

- All player models inside the `models/player/` folder will be cached in multiplayer. This avoids short lags/hitches when a player spawns with an un-cached model.

##### Master server

- Updated the master server to use [333networks](https://333networks.com/).
- Add support for multiple master servers. The server browser queries them all at once, and servers send updates to each. They are powered by the **333networks** community, managed independently. Even if one master goes down, others are used, ensuring constant availability of multiplayer.
- Iccups will occur less when fetching the server list if the network is really slow, or if the master server is unreachable.

#### Rendering

- On windowed mode, the hardware cursor is now used to navigate in the UI. This quickly allow users to get out of the window when bringing the console or the main menu up, instead of doing ALT+TAB.

#### Server

- The server is now showing the project version number in the server list.

## [0.81.1] - 2025-01-04

### Fixed

- Fixed the text of pulldown elements being invisible on some menus
- Fixed the server not taking the client rate into account and transmitting network fragments too fast, this may be the reason why some clients were unable to connect

## [0.81.0] - 2025-01-02

### Added

#### Audio

- Added support for IMA-ADPCM Wave sound files (4-bit compressed sound). Sounds such as sea waves (in the d-day landing mission) and subpen are now played accordingly

#### Client

- Added support for smaller lightmaps (BSP files having `_sml` suffix). Smaller lightmaps are enabled at startup when the texture detail is set to `Low` and if the map supports it (single-player levels of Spearhead and Breakthrough), useful for old low-end hardware.
- Added a new variable to customize the FOV client-side `cg_fov` (defaults to 80), the FOV is no longer an ephemeral server-side setting.
- The FOV is automatically adjusted depending on the aspect ratio

#### UI

- Automatically scale UI and HUD for resolutions above 1920x1080 (support for 2K and above). UI and HUD elements no longer look tiny on 4K resolutions

### Fixed

- The OpenAL library has been updated to version [1.24.1](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft/releases/tag/1.24.1).

#### Client

- Fixed the client getting stuck in the loading screen when disconnected due to an error
- Fixed the client loading the map twice when the server restarts and change map immediately
- Fixed the first person model not matching the player model

#### General

- Fixed letters with diacritic not being parsed nor displayed correctly in Spearhead and Breakthrough.
- Fixed a crash that would occur on some custom maps with a lot of grid patches (increased `MAX_PATCH_PLANES`).
- Fixed a rare crash that would occur when rendering static models under certain configurations.
- Fixed a stack overflow crash that would occur with a name of more than 30 characters.

#### AI

- Fixed singleplayer AI not aiming at the enemy while taking cover
- Fixed singleplayer AI not dropping weapons if forcedropweapon is set on the sentient and weapon drops are disabled in the level (should be better for Breakthrough single-player maps)
- Fixed a random crash that would occur when using multiplayer bots
- Improved multiplayer bot logic
- Fixed the match not ending after the clock reached 0:00 in round-based games

#### Game

- Fixed doors closing immediately when blocked (this bug also occurs in the original game)
- Fixed smoke grenades not reapparing when loading from save
- Fixed vehicle tank tandem causing a crash when a single turret was attached
- Make players non-solid when they're a passenger in a vehicle (fixes players getting hit/damaged by the moving vehicle)
- Prevent the player from going out of the maximum world bounds in noclip mode (as in mohaas/mohaab)
- Prevent the player from shooting silently by firing and dropping the weapon at the exact same time (this is trick is possible in the original game)
- When a door is blocked (voluntarily by a player or not), it will now try to open again in the other direction, to make the door not impossible to open (this is also an issue in the original game)

#### Multiplayer

- Fixed game messages not having a newline
- Fixed letters with accents not displaying in the chat box
- Fixed a bug that would make the player die or spawn with no inventory. This occurs when getting killed and respawning immediately (this bug also occurs in the original game)

- Fixed players getting the score from previous maps if they reconnect at the right moment (this bug also occurs in the original game)
- Fixed players deaths (or total kills) being added twice in round-based matches
- Fixed spawn metrics being terrible in FFA (like players respawning right behind other players)
- Fixed teamkill kick not displayed in Spearhead and Breakthrough

#### Server

- Fixed the result of the `status` command which prevented tools like `Advanced Security` from getting IP addresses (note: `Advanced Security` doesn't support IPv6 addresses)
- Fixed an issue where connecting clients would disconnect with the error `tried to parse cg message without cgame loaded`. This issue occurs in original 1.11, but was fixed in original 2.0 (Spearhead and Breakthrough)

#### UI

- Fixed an issue when resizing an in-game window, the window would stop being resized when the mouse was rapidly moving
- Fixed huddraw elements being wrongly positioned on wide screen when elements have virtualscale enabled
- Fixed pulldown menus being improperly focused and activated at the same time
- Fixed the crosshair being too small or hidden when a lower `Texture Detail` value (`r_picmip`) is set
- Properly handle long strings in the chat message box and in the game message box

### Changed

#### General

- Don't execute newconfig.cfg anymore as it overrides graphical settings.
- Some errors that show in console will only print in developer mode now (`developer` set to 1), as those are not relevant for the end-user.
- The `unnamedsoldier.cfg` configuration file will be used as a template for creating the `omconfig.cfg` configuration file if the latter doesn't exist

### Fixed

#### Audio

- Ambient sounds should now play correctly on all maps.
- Fixed a crash when the sound quality was set to a value lower to `High` (which means 44 kHz).
- Fixed an occurence where some sounds would loop forever. This would occur mostly when loading a saved game.
- Fixed background ambient sounds being muted when restarting after the intermission (this is a bug in the original game).

#### General

- Fixed a crash that could occur when no valid animation exist for a model.
- Fixed long subtitles not being displayed.

- Improved in-game Notepad support
- The UI should no longer lock up when refreshing/canceling the server list (this bug also occurs in the original game)

### Changed

#### Client

- As a protection, stufftext commands (commands that the server want clients to execute) are now filtered out, only some stufftext commands are allowed to prevent any alteration from a remote server.
