# Configuration and commands

## General configuration

This documentation currently only lists new changes that were introduced in OpenMoHAA. For a list of known settings, see [Server configuration](02-configuration-server.md).

If you want to use containers, see [Creating a Docker image](../02-running/04-docker.md).

### Home directory

OpenMoHAA uses a dedicated home directory by default for user data and mods. This behavior can be customized:

- `set fs_homepath Z:\openmohaa_data`: User data will be read and written in the directory located in `Z:\openmohaa_data`
- `set fs_homepath homedata`: The subdirectory `homedata` in the game directory will be used to read and store user data
- `set fs_homepath .`: Not recommended, the game directory will be used for storing user data, just like the original MOH:AA

#### Default paths by OS:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\openmohaa`
- Linux: `~/.openmohaa`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/openmohaa`

### Configure the network components

Network settings can be adjusted to use either IPv4, IPv6, or both. By default, IPv6 is disabled on dedicated servers.

- `set net_enabled 0`: Disable networking.
- `set net_enabled 1`: Enable IPv4 only (the default for dedicated servers).
- `set net_enabled 2`: Enable IPv6 only.
- `set net_enabled 3`: Enable both IPv4 and IPv6 (the default when running the standalone game).

> [!WARNING]
> The master server (using the GameSpy protocol) does not support IPv6. If IPv4 is disabled, the server won't show up in the public server list.

### Flood protection differences with MOH: Spearhead

Flood protection is turned off by default in OpenMoHAA (`sv_floodProtection 0`).

- In MOH: Allied Assault and OpenMoHAA, it monitors all commands.
- In MOH: Spearhead 2.0 and later, it monitors only text messages.

Flood protection prevents spam but can sometimes interfere with rapid actions like reloading and checking scores within a short period of time. It can be disabled with `set sv_floodProtection 0`.

For more details on preventing message spamming, check out the [Chat](#chat) section below.

### Updates

The game periodically checks for new versions in the GitHub project page in the background. Updates are not applied automatically, they must be downloaded and installed manually.

Update checking is enabled by default, but can be disabled with:
- `set net_enabled 0`, disables networking as mentioned aboe
- `set com_updatechecker_enabled 0`
- Compiling the project without libcurl support

If disabled, remember to check the project page for new versions. Updates can improve security and provide important fixes against exploits.

## Server configuration

### Optimization / Antichams

A new variable, `sv_netoptimize`, enables a feature that optimizes network bandwidth by not sending players information about others they can't see. For each client, the server optimizes by only transmitting data about players within their view. Clients will not receive information about players they can't see. This feature also helps protect against cheaters:

- `set sv_netoptimize 0`: Disable optimization - the default
- `set sv_netoptimize 1`: Enable optimization for entities that are moving
- `set sv_netoptimize 2`: Enable optimization, always

This option exists since **Medal of Honor: Allied Assault Breakthrough** 2.30, however it was improved in OpenMoHAA: sounds like footsteps will be sent so players don't get confused.

### Managing bans

Thanks to the [ioquake3](https://ioquake3.org/) project, IP bans are supported. Bans are saved in `serverbans.dat` by default, (modifiable with `sv_banFile` varaiable):

|Name       |Parameters                                      |Description
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|-----------
|rehashbans |                                                |Loads saved bans from the banlist file
|listbans   |                                                |Lists all banned IP addresses
|banaddr    |ip[*/subnet*] \| clientnum [*subnet*] [reason]  |Bans an IP through its address or through a client number, a subnet can be specified to ban a network range
|exceptaddr |ip[*/subnet*] \| clientnum [*subnet*]           |Adds an IP as an exception, for example IP ranges can be banned but one or more exceptions can be added
|bandel     |ip[*/subnet*] \| num                            |Unbans an IP address or a subnet, the entry number can be specified as an alternative
|exceptdel  |ip[*/subnet*] \| num                            |Removes a ban exception
|flushbans  |                                                |Removes all bans

Examples:

- `banaddr 192.168.5.2` bans IP address **192.168.5.2**.
- `banaddr 192.168.1.0/24` bans all **192.168.1.x** IP addresses (in the range **192.168.1.0**-**192.168.1.255**).
- `banaddr 2` bans the IP address of the client **#2**.
- `banaddr 4 24` bans the subnet of client **#4** - i.e if client .**#4** has IP **192.168.8.4**, then it bans all IPs ranging from **192.168.8.0**-**192.168.8.255**.
- `exceptaddr 3` ads the IP of client **#3** as an exception.
- `bandel 192.168.8.4` unbans **192.168.8.4**.
- `bandel 192.168.1.0/24` unbans the entire **192.168.1.0** subnet (IP ranging from **192.168.1.0**-**192.168.1.255**).

To calculate IP subnets, search for `IP subnet calculator` on Internet.

## Game settings

### Chat

Chat messages are logged to console and in the logfile by default, without requiring to set the `developer` variable.

The in-game chat behavior can be adjusted:

- `set g_instamsg_allowed 0`: Disable voice instant messages.
- `set g_instamsg_minDelay x`: Minimum delay (ms) between voice messages (default 1000)
- `set g_textmsg_allowed 0`: Disable all text messages. `All`, `team` and `private` messages will be disabled.
- `set g_textmsg_minDelay x`: Minimum delay (ms) between text messages (default 1000)

Temporarily disabling text messages can be useful in situations where tensions arise in the chat. Otherwise, it's best to keep them enabled under normal circumstances.

### Balancing teams

This prevents players from joining teams with more players than others. Disabled by default.

It can be enabled with: `set g_teambalance 1`.

This feature is passive: it only checks the team sizes when someone tries to join, so it won't automatically balance teams during the game.

> [!NOTE]
> This check doesn't apply in server scripts; it only works when clients join teams directly.

### Bots

OpenMoHAA introduced multiplayer bots which can be used for entertainment or for testing purposes. They appear in the scoreboard with their ping set to **bot**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Get the [mp-navigation](https://github.com/openmoh/mp-navigation) pk3, it is needed so bots can navigate through MP maps.

Configure bots with the following variables:

- `set sv_maxbots x`: **Required**, max number of bots allowed. The game can only handle a total of 64 players (clients), it will be limited to 64 minus the number of real players (`sv_maxclients`). For example, if you set `sv_maxclients` to 48, the maximum number of bots (sv_maxbots) can be 16.
- `set sv_numbots x`: Number of bots to spawn (capped at `sv_maxbots`).
- `set sv_minPlayers x`: Configure the minimum number of players required. If the number of real players in a team is below the specified value, the game will automatically add bots to fill the gap. For example, if `sv_minPlayers` is set to 8 and only 5 real players are active, the game will spawn 3 bots to make sure there are always 8 players in the game.

Example with the requirement of 6 players:
```cpp
set sv_maxbots 16 // Reserve 16 slots for bots
set sv_minPlayers 6 // Ensure each team has at least 6 players (bots are added if there are fewer players active)
```

Example with 4 bots playing:
```cpp
set sv_maxbots 16 // Reserve 16 slots for bots
set sv_numbots 4 // Spawn 4 bots
```

> [!NOTE]
> Bots have their ping set to **bot** in the scoreboard to avoid confusion with human or cheaters.
