# Installation guide

If you are on Windows, you can skip straight to [Windows quick install guide](02-installation-windows.md) for a simpler setup if MOH:AA is already installed.

## Before you start

The game should be able to run on any modern hardware. You can verify the [System requirements](03-requirements.md).

You will need a copy of MOH:AA, either from [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/medal_of_honor_allied_assault_war_chest), from CD or a from a [demo version](#obtaining-a-demo-version)

ðŸ’¡ *GOG version is recommended*.

If you already have MOH:AA from a CD, make sure to [Install official patches](#installing-official-patches-cd-only).

### Windows users

Download and install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

### Linux and macOS users

If you want to install the game from GOG:

1. Install [Innoextract](https://github.com/dscharrer/innoextract) (macOS users: `brew install innoextract`)
2. Run: `innoextract setup_medal_of_honor_2.0.0.21.exe`
3. Files will be extracted to a folder called `app/`

Alternatively, you can also use [WINE](https://www.winehq.org/), but this process may be slower/more complex if you do not already have it installed and configured. 

## Installation

### Downloading OpenMoHAA

1. Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/openmoh/openmohaa/releases/latest)
2. Choose the correct version for your platform:

|OS       |Kind of hardware (CPU, platform...)        |Archive
|---------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------
|Windows  |AMD/Intel                                  |`*-windows-x64.zip`
|Windows  |Qualcomm/Snapdragon (ARM-based)            |`*-windows-arm64.zip`
|macOS    |Apple Silicon or Intel                     |`*-macos-multiarch.arm64-x86_64.zip`
|Linux    |AMD/Intel                                  |`*-linux-amd64`
|Linux    |Raspberry Pi 4 or 5                        |`*-linux-arm64`

### Installing OpenMoHAA

#### Option A

- Extract the archive<sup>1</sup> to your MOHAA installation directory.
- Create a shortcut to each of the **launch_openmohaa_\*** executable:
  - `launch_openmohaa_base` (Base game)
  - `launch_openmohaa_spearhead` (Spearhead)
  - `launch_openmohaa_breakthrough` (Breakthrough)

#### Option B

- Extract the archive<sup>1</sup> somewhere on your hard drive
- create a shortcut to each of the **launch_openmohaa_\*** executable:
  - `launch_openmohaa_base` (Base game)
  - `launch_openmohaa_spearhead` (Spearhead)
  - `launch_openmohaa_breakthrough` (Breakthrough)
- Set the shortcut's `Start in` directory to your MOHAA installation directory.

ðŸŸ¢ You're now ready to play!

----

**Notes:**

1. For servers, only `omohaaded.*`, `game.*`, and `curl` binaries from the archive are required.

## Appendix

### (Optional) Cleaning up the game installation directory

If you want to clean up the mohaa installation directory by keeping only what is needed for OpenMoHAA, the following files/directories can be kept:
```cpp
[MOHAA]
â”œâ”€â”€ [main]
|   â”œâ”€â”€ [sound]
|   â”œâ”€â”€ [video]
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ Pak*.pk3 // all pak files
â”œâ”€â”€ [mainta]
|   â”œâ”€â”€ [sound]
|   â”œâ”€â”€ [video]
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ pak*.pk3 // all pak files
â”œâ”€â”€ [maintt]
|   â”œâ”€â”€ [sound]
|   â”œâ”€â”€ [video]
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ pak*.pk3 // all pak files
â”œâ”€â”€ All files from the OpenMoHAA archive
```

## Other platforms and ports

OpenMoHAA is officially supported on *Windows*, *Linux* and *macOS*. Below is a list of unofficial open-source ports that required custom modifications to the OpenMoHAA source code to build and run:

- https://github.com/3246251196/openmohaa/tree/AmigaOS4_0_81_1 AmigaOS
- https://github.com/Cowcat5150/openmohaa MorphOS
- https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/openmohaa PS Vita

To stay up to date with the latest features and fixes from the official repository, these ports depend on their respective maintainers to synchronize changes with the main OpenMoHAA codebase.
