## Intro

The main goal of OpenMoHAA is to ensure the future and continuity of **Medal of Honor: Allied Assault** (including Spearhead and Breakthrough expansions) on all platforms/architectures by providing new patches/features. Thanks to the ioquake3 project and the F.A.K.K SDK, OpenMoHAA has already reached more than half of its goal: an open-source version of MoH:AA (based on version 2.40) that is fully compatible with both the original game and expansions, in terms of network protocol, assets, and scripts. OpenMoHAA is compatible with both MOH:AA servers and clients (Spearhead and Breakthrough included).

## Getting started

- [Downloading and installing OpenMoHAA](docs/getting_started_installation.md)
- [Running OpenMoHAA and using expansion assets](docs/getting_started_running.md)
- [Dedicated server configuration](docs/configuration/server.md)

## Current state

### Single-player

The entire single-player campaign should work (Allied Assault, Spearhead and Breakthrough). If you encounter any bug, please create a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/openmoh/openmohaa/issues) describing them.

### Multiplayer

The Multiplayer part is almost fully stable.

Server admins can use OpenMoHAA to [host](docs/getting_started_installation.md#server) a mohaa/mohaas/mohaab server. Bugs must be reported by creating a new [issue](https://github.com/openmoh/openmohaa/issues) on the OpenMoHAA GitHub project. Players can use OpenMoHAA to [play](docs/getting_started_installation.md#client) on a mohaa/mohaas/mohaab server.

All game modes including `Tug-of-War` from Medal of Honor: Spearhead, and `Liberation` from Medal of Honor: Breakthrough are implemented and are working as intended. Mods like `Freeze-Tag` are working as well.
