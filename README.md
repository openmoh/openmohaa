## What is OpenMoHAA?

OpenMoHAA is an open-source project aimed at preserving and enhancing **Medal of Honor: Allied Assault** (including Spearhead and Breakthrough expansions) by providing more features and bugfixes, across modern platforms and architectures.

Powered by [ioquake3](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3) and the [F.A.K.K SDK](https://code.idtech.space/ritual/fakk2-sdk), OpenMoHAA provides:
- Full compatibility with the original game: assets, scripts and multiplayer
- Better support for modern systems
- Cross-platform support (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Support for both single-player and multiplayer modes
- Includes all fixes from Spearhead 2.15 and Breakthrough 2.40b
- More fixes and features, such as bots and a ban system

## Reporting Issues

> [!NOTE]
> OpenMoHAA hasn't hit version 1.0.0 yet. Think of it like a beta build from the golden age of LAN parties. Features are being added, bugs are getting squashed, and more things are being tweaked. Things might change, break, or get even better over time.
> 
> If that sounds like your kind of mission, gear up, frag some bots, and help level up OpenMoHAA!

- Submit an [issue](https://github.com/openmoh/openmohaa/issues) on GitHub (use the template).
